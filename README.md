User Directory Pro
This is a personal project I’m building to master Flutter's core concepts. My main focus here is moving beyond basic UI and learning how to handle data professionally and write scalable code.

Key Features & Progress:
Object-Oriented Data Handling: Instead of passing individual strings between screens, I’ve implemented a global UserModel. This makes the code much cleaner and easier to maintain.

Local Persistence: I’m using Shared Preferences to ensure user data is saved locally on the device.

Custom UI & UX: Built a dynamic profile listing with Material 3 design, using InkWell for better touch feedback and a dedicated details screen for each user.

Modular Structure: The project is organized into Models, Services, and Screens to follow industry-standard folder structures.

What's Next?
Implementing an Edit feature to update existing user profiles.

Migrating from local storage to Firebase for real-time data sync.

Adding a search functionality to filter through the user list.
